Pgweb is a cross-platform web-based database browser for PostgreSQL, written in Go.

Bookmarks for servers can be created and stored in `/home/pgweb/.pgweb/bookmarks`, but there is a [limitation](https://github.com/sosedoff/pgweb/issues/652) since v0.13 (and still present in v0.16) that requires the password to be included in the bookmark file.
