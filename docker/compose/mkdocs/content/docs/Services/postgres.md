## Requirements

PostgreSQL tools are required on your machine to connect to Postgres and run the `backup` and `sample` tasks.

pgAdmin is provided in this lab as a web interface for PostgreSQL. This comes pre-configured with connections to all included versions.

There are always 5 supported versions of PostgreSQL. The latest version keeps the default port `5432`, for each older version this is incremented by 1, up to a maximum `5436`.
