A graph query engine for all your data.

PuppyGraph enables you to query your data as a graph by directly connecting to your data warehouses and lakes. This eliminates the need to build and maintain time-consuming ETL pipelines needed with a traditional graph database setup. No more waiting for data and failed ETL processes.
