        "SQL Server has supported Linux containers since 2017. All versions since then are included in this lab. The latest version is exposed on the default port `1433`, with each older version using the next port number (`1434`, `1435` etc). When new versions are released (every 2-3 years) these port numbers will increment to ensure the latest version is always using the default port."
